Get involved in Waku's open-source initiatives to improve the protocol, implementations, developer tools, and documentation.

## Run a Node

The Waku network is permissionless and decentralized, consisting of nodes. It is open for anyone to run their node, use the network, and contribute to its support. Please visit the [nwaku guide for operators](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku/tree/master/docs/operators) to learn more.

## Build a Waku Application

By integrating Waku into your application, you can contribute by:

- Running a Waku node within your application.
- Reporting bugs and suggesting missing features to the development team.
- Inspiring other developers to explore and utilize Waku for [various use cases](/overview/use-cases).

Begin your journey by exploring [Waku's diverse platforms](/platform/overview) and start building today!
